# Detecing Motion with your Raspberry Pi

This repo contains sample Python code that will run with Raspberry Pi with a PIR sensor wired to it. I used [these](https://www.amazon.com/EMY-HC-SR501-Pyroelectric-Infrared-Detector/dp/B00FDPO9B8/ref=sr_ph_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1518477484&sr=sr-1).

It also contains a quick webpage I am using to monitor the motion.

This content and detailed how-tos can be found in my blog post (link coming).
